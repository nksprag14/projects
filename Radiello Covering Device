# This was a project worked on throughout my snior year of college both 
# for a class (Multidisciplinary Design & Prototyping) and an independent 
# study with another student, Patrick Kirby. My professor for the class 
# and advisor for the study was Dr. James Jackson Potter, faculty at WashU 
# in St. Louis. The clients were researchers at WashU that were using 
# atmospheric sensors to measure harmful chemical readings near farmland 
# in rural Missouri to see the effects of livestock on air quality. The 
# project involved devloping a device that could cover and uncover the 
# atmospheric sensors depending on wind direction and could be left out 
# in the field for long periods of time without requiring much maintenance.
